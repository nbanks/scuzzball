*** About ScuzzBall ***

ScuzzBall is a DOS game that Nathan Banks started during a Grade 11 maths
class when it got too boring.  He wanted to play JezzBall on an old Toshiba
T1000 XT laptop.  He contintued to work on the game over the following years
before abandoning it when the market for DOS shareware games disappeared. At
the end of the project, Nathan had written about 25000 lines of Pascal and
Assembler code for the three projects.

The game expanded from ScuzzBall into a Nibbles and Checkers game which are
included as part of this package.

*** Installation ***

The following are the instructions for installing scuzzball on a Debian/Ubuntu
system. The Dosbox commands should work in any operating systems.


1. Install DOSBOX:

    sudo apt-get install dosbox

2. Create a directory for your dos programs.

    DOS=~/dos
    mkdir $DOS

3. Download the self-extracting executables for scuzzball.

    You may download the executables, or install from source:
    For the executables:

        cd $DOS
        wget http://bnathan.com/scuzzball/scuzz.exe
        wget http://bnathan.com/scuzzball/nibbles.exe
        wget http://bnathan.com/scuzzball/checkers.exe

    To compile, you will need a copy of Borland Turbo Pascal 7.0 for DOS.
    If you google "Turbo Pascal", you may come across a copy.
    After getting it, you will want to clone the ScuzzBall repository:
        cd $DOS
        git clone https://github.com/nbanks/scuzzball.git scuzzbal

4. Start dosbox, mount your directory, and extract the files.

    First, start dosbox and mount your dos directory
        dosbox
        mount c ~/dos
        c:

    Hint: Press control-F12 a few times to increase the processor speed slightly.
    Hint: Press Alt-Enter to enter full-screen mode.

    To Install from executables, use:
        scuzz.exe
        nibbles.exe
        checkers.exe

    To Install from source, first add turbo pascal to the path:
        set PATH=%PATH%;\TP\BIN

    Next compile each of the programs:
        cd scuzzbal\scuzzbal
        tpc -B scuzzbal
        cd ..\checkers
        tpc -B checkers
        cd ..\nibbles
        tpc -B nibbles

5. Play the games! I find ScuzzBall and nibbles most fun.

        dir
        cd Scuzzbal
        scuzzbal
        cd \nibbles
        nibbles
        cd \checkers
        checkers
    (For nibbles, I usually use a speed of 256.)
